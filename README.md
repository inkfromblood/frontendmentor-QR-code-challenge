## Overview
This project from Fronted Mentor was to replicate a QR Code design based on a JPG using only HTML and CSS.

## My process
My process was a lot of trial and error.
I began by going through the structure from top to bottom.
Then styling each element as best as I could from top to bottom. When I got stuck with one, I moved onto the next.

Initially I had trouble getting the QR code image to stay within the bounds of the container div.
Upon doing some research, some folks were using the flexbox, but all I had to do was change the width for the QR code img to be 100% and add padding.
There may be more efficient ways to do this however.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned about box shadows and how to maniuplate them. The box shadow in the example is super subtle and so it was challenging to get it to be similar, while using the spread to reduce the shadow spilling over edges other than the bottom.

This was a great project to reinforce the basics that I have just learned about HTML and CSS.
It took longer than I thought it would.

### Continued development

I definitely need more practice to get to the point where I can approach a project like this with confidence.
I felt confident in a lot of the aspects but there was a lot of trial and error.
